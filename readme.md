# TC-RENO

# Pipeline for isoforms identification and quantification <br>
TC-RENO modifies the clustering method of TrackCluster and expands the existing functions. <br>

## Update the clustering method
1. Existing isoforms reported in Araport11 would be clustered together even if the similarity score between the two isoforms is below the cut-off.
2. The clustering result varied by the ordering of reads. Alteration of the read order results in a different number of supported reads (i.e. subreads) in the final identified isoform.
3. Wrong method of computing isoformsâ€™ supporting reads
4. TrackCluster mistakenly identifies some real isoforms as fragments and discarded them.


## Function extension:
1. The defaut TrackCluster only identifies novel isoforms that intersect with the existing gene annotation. For those remaining reads that did not align to the existing isoforms, we developed a new function, de novo identification, to further cluster them together.
2. Short isoforms with enough supporting reads would be saved.

# Quick start
## 1. Preprocess
Use bam2bigg.py of TrackCluster to convert bam files to bed file.<br>
Use gff2bigg.py of TrackCluster to convert gff files to bed file.<br>
## 2. Isoform identification and quantification
``` 
python TC_RENO.py -i reads.bed   -r ref.bed -o isoforms.bed -q isoforms_exp.txt -tmp /dev/shm/tmp/
```
